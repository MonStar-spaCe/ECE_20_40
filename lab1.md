Use of some common tags of markdown are as follows:

- `hash tags` are used to indicate `header`.
- `single asterick` is used to indicate _italic_.
- `double asterick` is used to indicate **bold**.
- `double tilt` is used to `strick through` a text. (~~no cap~~)
- `arithmatic signs(+ or - or *)` can be used to indicate bullet or make lists.
- `three underscore` or `three asterick` or `three highfen` can be used to create `horizontal lines`.

#### We can learn more about markdown from [Google](https://www.markup.io/)
[freeCodeCamp] (https://www.google.com/)

Here is a logo of Codepen software which will come very handy if you want to practice markup and markdown.

We can create a table using bar and highfen. For example:

| Programming | Scripting | Markup | Markdown |
| ----------- | --------- | ------ | -------- |
| C, C++      | JS        | HTML   | .md      |

- We can used three single qoutation to create a code block. For example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head> </head>
  <body>
    <button></button>
    <script></script>
  </body>
</html>
```
